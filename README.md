# 🏙️ Madrid Air Quality Analysis 

This project analyzes air pollution data from Madrid between 2008 and 2018, producing animated and interactive visualizations to track changes in pollutant levels. It includes an interactive Dash app for monitoring percentage change in pollutants, detailed 2018 station-wise pollution analysis, and maps showing improvements or worsening of air quality over time.
